#### Live Server on Visual Studio Code:
- When working on web development projects, you often need to manually refresh the browser to see the changes you make in your code. The Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code automates this process by creating a local development server. With Live Server, any time you save your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, the browser will automatically refresh to reflect those changes instantly. This significantly enhances your productivity and eliminates the need for constant manual refreshing.
